  UPDATED---\today. Modern climbing assistance systems allow defining routes using external devices. This makes the training process unintuitive. We believe such a system should be able to autonomously record and identify routes by observing the climber. The difficulty here is to provide a reliable detection of the holds grabbed. We tackle this issue using a hybrid approach based on visual analysis with a measurement of the muscle activity. In particular, this works as follows: First, we utilize the data given by Beta-Cube to match the position of the hand or foot with the closest hold. Second, we use the Myo muscle tracker to determine if the hold was actually grabbed.
  
  \textbf{TODO:} Adapt to new technologies (e.g. no myo muscle tracker) and new goals (e.g. covered hands and feet). \\
